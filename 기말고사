When you feel like you don't fit in
Jonathan Livingston Seagull is different from other seagulls. Instead of fighting over food, he spends his time learning to fly better. Every day, he practices rolling, spinning, and diving high above the sea. One day, he flies through his flock, hoping they will praise him. Instead, they look at him coldly, thinking he doesn't fit in. Jonathan tries to rejoin the flock, but he can't be happy because he loves flying high in the sky.
If you ever feel different, remember Jonathan Livingston Seagull's message. Don't be afraid to be different. There's no need to say sorry for who you are. Being different makes you special. Embrace it, learn more, and keep getting better at what makes you unique.
