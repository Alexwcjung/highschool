Jonathan Livingston Seagull is different from other seagulls. Instead of fighting over food, he spends his time learning to fly better. Every day, he practices rolling, spinning, and diving high above the sea. One day, he flies through his flock, hoping they will praise him. Instead, they look at him coldly, thinking he doesn't fit in. Jonathan tries to rejoin the flock, but he can't be happy because he loves flying high in the sky.
If you ever feel different, remember Jonathan Livingston Seagull's message. Don't be afraid to be different. There's no need to say sorry for who you are. Being different makes you special. Embrace it, learn more, and keep getting better at what makes you unique.
## 2. From trash into treasure(교과서 44~48 요약본)
Every day at lunch, Jamie drinks a soda and wonders what to do with the empty can. Instead of just recycling it, Jamie could try "upcycling." Upcycling means reusing the can in a fun and creative way.
For example, Markus and Daniel make strong bags from old car seat belts. Kyle Parsons turns old motorcycle tires into sandal bottoms. Big things like old buildings can also be upcycled. In Germany, they turn an old steel plant into a park with gardens and bike paths.
Artists also do upcycling. Tom makes big pictures from trash, and Gwyneth paints designs on used coffee cups.
By upcycling, we reduce waste and help the environment. Jamie could turn his empty cans into lanterns, toys, or sculptures.
